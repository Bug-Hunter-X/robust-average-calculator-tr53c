# Python: Handling Empty Lists and Non-Numeric Values in Average Calculation

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python when calculating the average of a list of numbers: not handling empty lists or lists containing non-numeric values.

The `bug.py` file shows the initial function with these errors. The `bugSolution.py` file shows the improved version which addresses these issues, making the function more robust and preventing unexpected errors.
